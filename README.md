# Tic-Tac-Game-C-Project
classic two-player strategy game played on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to be the first to complete a row, column, or diagonal with your symbol, which is typically "X" or "O."

Let's dive into some of the key features of this project:

Modes:
The game have two modes:
1. Multiplayer mode (where two players are playing against each other).
2. Single player mode including hard and easy mode (where only single player is playing against the program with smart algorithm).
   
Inputs:
 * The game accept the following inputs:
1. Input to quit the game at any time.
2. Two Input to select between the two available modes, on signle mode can select other to mode 
3. Input with the position of where to place your sign on the tic tac toe board using the NUMPAD.
 
Operation:
1. The game should detect if winning or draw position occurred.
2. The game should detect who is the winner.
3. After detection of the winner the game should ask if you want to play again to start from the beginning.

Algorithm:
- Inside the single player mode I implement 2 mode (easy and hard) with smart algorithm that tries to win the game against the user.

Display:
1. The game  display the board empty at the game beginning
2. Then it  display the updated board after each player’s turn.
3. The game  display any necessary guiding text for the user.
For example:
○ The software  display a text that asks the user to choose between the two available
game modes (single player or multiplayer).
○ The software  display which player of the two players is the winner.
○ Also it  display the number of the player whose turn it is.
○ The software  display  guiding text like the text that asks if the player wants to
play again or if the player wants to quit the game.
